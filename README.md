# Web3 From 0 to Dev
In this repo I will collect all necessary sources and guides, with my comments, for you to become a Web3 developer even with no prior programming experience.


*Disclaimer* 

This guide is created for people with little to none prior programming experience, who want to start discovering the amazing world of Blockchain and Web3 development. Thus, our focus is basically on getting your programming skills from zero to a confident blockchain user, who can confidently use programming documentation and creating your own projects without external help.


Intro


So, you've decided to discover the beautiful world of blockchain and Web3 development for yourself, but you're intimidated, lost and don't know where to start? Amazing, I welcome you on this path, let me be your guide! As mentioned previously, this guide is designed for people with very little or no previous coding experience. I just think it is not fair that a vast majority of guides out there assume that you're an experienced Web2 developer, transferring to Web3. In that case, your learning curve will be much easier and faster, since you already know most of the programming concepts and methods. You can compare it to learning a new foreign language, where people with prior knowledge of other languages learn new ones much faster. 

Luckily it is not the case for you, and It was not the case for me, we have to start from the A's and B's of programming. Why did I say luckily? Because it is an amazing challenge after successfully competing which, you will become much more knowledgeable, having discovered the whole world of Blockchain and Web3, with its secrets and opportunities.


1. Brave New World

Welcome to the world of computing and programming! It is hard to imagine a person living in a modern world, which is not using computer in any form countless time per day, and since you are reading this blog, you are not one of them. Nonetheless, it is importnat to understand that the world of consumer technology has been finely crafted and tuned by the world's most prominent programmers and UI designers, so that the process for us users would be intuitive and as smooth as possible. This approach results in a fact, that although we all use computers daily, we don't really know how they operate.

Our first goal on the path of becomming a Blockchain developer is to change that! Before getting into the world of smart contracts, blockchain, NFTs and DeFis we will first learn how the computer hardware and software operate, how does the internet work, what's the future of computing technology? Even if you're familiar with many basic concepts of computing, I highly reccomend not skipping this first step of learning how to stand, before trying to walk.

Sources and materials:

There's an uncountable ammount of crash courses on entry level computing and programming, which really depends on wehther you like to read, watch or listen your material, make sure this preparatory stage isn't taking too long for you, roughly speaking couple of weeks should be more than enough. I personally found the way of explanation and slicing of the material in this popular video course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo
