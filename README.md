# Web3 From 0 to Dev
In this repo I will collect all necessary sources and guides, with my comments, for you to become a Web3 developer even with no prior programming experience.


*Disclaimer* 

This guide is created for people with little to none prior programming experience, who want to start discovering the amazing world of Blockchain and Web3 development. Thus, our focus is basically on getting your programming skills from zero to a confident blockchain user, who can confidently use programming documentation and creating your own projects without external help. I separated the guide into steps, so there's a more clear approach to becomming a developer. At the end of every chapter I will be posting resources and recoomendations, as well as estimated time of complition.

  Intro


So, you've decided to discover the beautiful world of blockchain and Web3 development for yourself, but you're intimidated, lost and don't know where to start? Amazing, I welcome you on this path, let me be your guide! As mentioned previously, this guide is designed for people with very little or no previous coding experience. I just think it is not fair that a vast majority of guides out there assume that you're an experienced Web2 developer, transferring to Web3. In that case, your learning curve will be much easier and faster, since you already know most of the programming concepts and methods. You can compare it to learning a new foreign language, where people with prior knowledge of other languages learn new ones much faster. 

Luckily it is not the case for you, and It was not the case for me, we have to start from the A's and B's of programming. Why did I say luckily? Because it is an amazing challenge after successfully competing which, you will become much more knowledgeable, having discovered the whole world of Blockchain and Web3, with its secrets and opportunities.


1. Brave New World

Estimated time of complition: 2-4 weeks (30-60 hours)

Welcome to the world of computing and programming! It is hard to imagine a person living in a modern world, which is not using computer in any form countless time per day, and since you are reading this blog, you are not one of them. Nonetheless, it is importnat to understand that the world of consumer technology has been finely crafted and tuned by the world's most prominent programmers and UI designers, so that the process for us users would be intuitive and as smooth as possible. This approach results in a fact, that although we all use computers daily, we don't really know how they operate.

Our first goal on the path of becomming a Blockchain developer is to change that! Before getting into the world of smart contracts, blockchain, NFTs and DeFis we will first learn how the computer hardware and software operate, how does the internet work, what's the future of computing technology? Even if you're familiar with many basic concepts of computing, I highly reccomend not skipping this first step of learning how to stand, before trying to walk.

  Sources and materials:

There's an uncountable ammount of crash courses on entry level computing and programming, which really depends on wehther you like to read, watch or listen your material, make sure this preparatory stage isn't taking too long for you, roughly speaking couple of weeks should be more than enough. I personally found the way of explanation and slicing of the material in this popular video course: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tpIctyqH29Q&list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo

Another popular source to get all the basic computing knowledge from is Stanford's Computer Science 101, although a longer but a more well rounded approach compared to youtube guides- https://online.stanford.edu/courses/soe-ycscs101-sp-computer-science-101.


2. From Theory to Practice 

Estimated time of complition: ~2 months (100-150 hours)

I would imagine that the time for completion of this part would upset a good number of people who firmly decided to become Blockchain developers from 0, but unfortunatelly the estimated time for the whole path from 0 to a junior developer is from 6 to 12 months with avereragely 3 hours of studying and practicing daily. You have to remember that college students take several years for what we want to achieve in under a year. You will have to put in hours and get familiar with code, no way around it. Nonetheless, I encourage you not to be spooked by this fact, firsty nothing good comes easy and learning how to code is deffinetely something you will be immensely proud about, secondly we will apply the tactic of "cutting elephant into pieces", separating whole programming journey into smaller more approachable tasks. Sounds good? Let us continue then and become one step closer to becomming real Blockchain developer.  

After we learned our bits and bytes with the basic computer course it is finally time to start approaching our first programming language. As you might know, not all programming languages are created equal. You can compare every language to a tool in a tool box, which has it's own unique mission. Some languages like Java Script (later JS) are used to do Front-end development like the websites all users see, some are designed to work with databases or Back-end like Java or Python, something a regular user would never see, but which is a crucial part of every application. In reality every language is a multitool (you can do web development on Python or data analysis on JS) but we will stick to the previous comparison for now. 

So where do we start? Most used language of DApps (decentralized applications) and Web3 in general is Java Script, it is also the most popular language for development, which seems like a perfect start for us!

To learn JS from start is not an impossible although not an easy task. Short youtube courses won't be unough for majority of beginners, that's where online courses step in.  As with the previous step, wide arrangement of courses starting just from few dollars, going up to personalized extensive bootcamps. Choice solely depends on your time availability. If you feel like you are able yuo put in 5-6 hours into coding daily and finish learning JS faster, than do it and go for bootcamps, if you have only couple of hours a day available with more hours on weekends, choose courses with no time limitation. Most important thing to remember is consistency. 

Ideally you should practise coding everyday! Even if it is just 15-20 minutes sometimes. Might seem not like much but you will progress much much faster comppared to people who do several days or more of pausing.

So, our main goal is to get comfortable at Web development, using all modern packages for JS as React, Node etc. Let's say you should be able to create a website using React and Next with a good degree on confidence.
