# Web3 From 0 to Dev
In this repo I will collect all necessary sources and guides, with my comments, for you to become a Web3 developer even with no prior programming experience.


*Disclaimer* 

This guide is created for people with little to none prior programming experience, who want to start discovering the amazing world of Blockchain and Web3 development. Thus, our focus is basically on getting your programming skills from zero to a confident blockchain user, who can confidently use programming documentation and creating your own projects without external help.


Intro


So, you've decided to discover the beautiful world of blockchain and Web3 development for yourself, but you're intimidated, lost and don't know where to start? Amazing, I welcome you on this path, let me be your guide! As mentioned previously, this guide is designed for people with very little or no previous coding experience. I just think it is not fair that a vast majority of guides out there assume that you're an experienced Web2 developer, transferring to Web3. In that case, your learning curve will be much easier and faster, since you already know most of the programming concepts and methods. You can compare it to learning a new foreign language, where people with prior knowledge of other languages learn new ones much faster. 

Luckily it is not the case for you, and It was not the case for me, we have to start from the A's and B's of programming. Why did I say luckily? Because it is an amazing challenge after successfully competing which, you will become much more knowledgeable, having discovered the whole world of Blockchain and Web3 , with its secrets and opportunities.
